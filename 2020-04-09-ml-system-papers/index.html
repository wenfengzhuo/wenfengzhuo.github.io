                <p>Machine learning system is a specialized system that is built for solving problems with machine learning deeply integrated. While it has existed for a while, machine learning is just becoming popular in recent decades compared with other technologies. </p>
<p>As more machine learning based solutions are deployed in production, the system around ML has evolved as well. Majority of ML systems are tackling specific problems such as personalization, recommendation and ads ranking. There is also a trend in generalized machine learning system that solves a variety of problems. To learn how a machine learning system is built, the best way is probably through practice with real-life projects. The second best way is by reading papers published by well-known companies that specialize in applied machine learning. </p>
<p>Below is a list of good papers that I personally have learned a lot from, and hopefully you will distill useful knowledge for your interests.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ABSTRACT<br/>
Creating and maintaining a platform for reliably producing and
deploying machine learning models requires careful or- chestration of
many components—a learner for generating models based on training
data, modules for analyzing and val- idating both data as well as
models, and finally infrastructure for serving models in production.
This becomes particularly challenging when data changes over time and
fresh models need to be produced continuously. Unfortunately, such or-
chestration is often done ad hoc using glue code and custom scripts
developed by individual teams for specific use cases, leading to
duplicated effort and fragile systems with high technical debt.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ABSTRACT<br/>
Online advertising allows advertisers to only bid and pay for
measurable user responses, such as clicks on ads. As a consequence,
click prediction systems are central to most on- line advertising
systems. With over 750 million daily active users and over 1 million
active advertisers, predicting clicks on Facebook ads is a challenging
machine learning task. In this paper we introduce a model which
combines decision trees with logistic regression, outperforming either
of these methods on its own by over 3%, an improvement with sig-
nificant impact to the overall system performance. We then explore how
a number of fundamental parameters impact the final prediction
performance of our system. Not surpris- ingly, the most important
thing is to have the right features: those capturing historical
information about the user or ad dominate other types of features.
Once we have the right features and the right model (decisions trees
plus logistic re- gression), other factors play small roles (though
even small improvements are important at scale). Picking the optimal
handling for data freshness, learning rate schema and data sampling
improve the model slightly, though much less than adding a high-value
feature, or picking the right model to begin with.</p>

<p><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2487575.2488215">Predictive model performance: offline and online evaluations</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>ABSTRACT<br/>
We study the accuracy of evaluation metrics used to estimate the
efficacy of predictive models. Offline evaluation metrics are
indicators of the expected model performance on real data. However, in
practice we often experience substantial discrepancy between the
offline and online performance of the models.</p>
<p>We investigate the characteristics and behaviors of the evaluation
metrics on offline and online testing both analytically and
empirically by experimenting them on online advertising data from the
Bing search engine. One of our findings is that some offline metrics
like AUC (the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve)
and RIG (Relative Information Gain) that summarize the model
performance on the entire spectrum of operating points could be quite
misleading sometimes and result in significant discrepancy in offline
and online metrics. For example, for click prediction models for
search advertising, errors in predictions in the very low range of
predicted click scores impact the online performance much more
negatively than errors in other regions. Most of the offline metrics
we studied including AUC and RIG, however, are insensitive to such
model behavior.</p>
<p>We designed a new model evaluation paradigm that simulates the online
behavior of predictive models. For a set of ads selected by a new
prediction model, the online user behavior is estimated from the
historic user behavior in the search logs. The experimental results on
click prediction model for search advertising are highly promising.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ABSTRACT<br/>
Generalized linear models with nonlinear feature transfor- mations are
widely used for large-scale regression and clas- sification problems
with sparse inputs. Memorization of fea- ture interactions through a
wide set of cross-product feature transformations are effective and
interpretable, while gener- alization requires more feature
engineering effort. With less feature engineering, deep neural
networks can generalize bet- ter to unseen feature combinations
through low-dimensional dense embeddings learned for the sparse
features. However, deep neural networks with embeddings can
over-generalize and recommend less relevant items when the user-item
inter- actions are sparse and high-rank. In this paper, we present
Wide &amp; Deep learning—jointly trained wide linear models and deep
neural networks—to combine the benefits of mem- orization and
generalization for recommender systems. We productionized and
evaluated the system on Google Play, a commercial mobile app store
with over one billion active users and over one million apps. Online
experiment results show that Wide &amp; Deep significantly increased app
acquisi- tions compared with wide-only and deep-only models. We have
also open-sourced our implementation in TensorFlow.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ABSTRACT<br/>
YouTube represents one of the largest scale and most sophis- ticated
industrial recommendation systems in existence. In this paper, we
describe the system at a high level and fo- cus on the dramatic
performance improvements brought by deep learning. The paper is split
according to the classic two-stage information retrieval dichotomy:
first, we detail a deep candidate generation model and then describe a
sepa- rate deep ranking model. We also provide practical lessons and
insights derived from designing, iterating and maintain- ing a massive
recommendation system with enormous user- facing impact.</p>

<p><a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/fa17/cse291-b/reading/Rendle2010FM.pdf">Factorization Machines</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>ABSTRACT <br/>
In this paper, we introduce Factorization Machines (FM) which
are a new model class that combines the advantages of Support Vector
Machines (SVM) with factorization models. Like SVMs, FMs are a general
predictor working with any real valued feature vector. In contrast to
SVMs, FMs model all interactions between variables using factorized
parameters. Thus they are able to estimate interactions even in
problems with huge sparsity (like recommender systems) where SVMs
fail. We show that the model equation of FMs can be calculated in
linear time and thus FMs can be optimized directly. So unlike
nonlinear SVMs, a transformation in the dual form is not necessary and
the model parameters can be estimated directly without the need of any
support vector in the solution. We show the relationship to SVMs and
the advantages of FMs for parameter estimation in sparse settings.</p>
<p>On the other hand there are many different factorization mod- els like
matrix factorization, parallel factor analysis or specialized models
like SVD++, PITF or FPMC. The drawback of these models is that they
are not applicable for general prediction tasks but work only with
special input data. Furthermore their model equations and optimization
algorithms are derived individually for each task. We show that FMs
can mimic these models just by specifying the input data (i.e. the
feature vectors). This makes FMs easily applicable even for users
without expert knowledge in factorization models.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.03982.pdf">SlowFast Networks for Video Recognition</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>ABSTRACT<br/>
We present SlowFast networks for video recognition. Our model involves
(i) a Slow pathway, operating at low frame rate, to capture spatial
semantics, and (ii) a Fast path- way, operating at high frame rate, to
capture motion at fine temporal resolution. The Fast pathway can be
made very lightweight by reducing its channel capacity, yet can learn
useful temporal information for video recognition. Our models achieve
strong performance for both action classification and detection in
video, and large improve- ments are pin-pointed as contributions by
our SlowFast con- cept. We report state-of-the-art accuracy on major
video recognition benchmarks, Kinetics, Charades and AVA. Code has
been made available at: https://github.com/facebookresearch/SlowFast.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ABSTRACT<br/>
Giving people the power to build community is central to Face- book’s
mission. Technically, searching for communities poses very different
challenges compared to the standard IR problems. First, there is a
vocabulary mismatch problem since most of the content of the
communities is private. Second, the common labeling strategies based
on human ratings and clicks do not work well due to limited public
content available to third-party raters and users at search time.
Finally, community search has a dual objective of satisfying searchers
and growing the number of active communities. While A/B testing is a
well known approach for assessing the former, it is an open question
on how to measure progress on the latter. This talk discusses these
challenges in depth and describes our solution.</p>
